# ![neptune program icon](/nc-logo.png?raw=true "neptune program icon") Neptune

[![Screenshot of the program](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot of neptune")](/screenshot.png?raw=true).

Neptune is a network based variant of the popular [SameGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame) written in Java using the Java Net API and Java SWING.

I wrote this program from scratch back in 2009 at high school as a learning project to get used to network programming and deepen my knowledge about SWING. Furthermore I tried out various design patterns (like a MVC variant) to get used to them. Neptune is based on the [Clientâ€“server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) where the Neptune Server serves the game to the Neptune clients which compete against each other. 

The following resources are available in the repository:

 - Complete Neptune source code which can be opened directly with NetBeans IDE 8.1
 - The protocol specifications: [the original specification (v1)](/protocol_v1-[06-11-09].pdf?raw=true) and [the updated specification (v2)](/protocol_v2-[06-12-09].pdf?raw=true) (only in German)
 - [A short presentation](/neptune-1.5G.pdf?raw=true) (only in German)

**Tip:** you can read and see more about Neptune on my project archive [here](http://maxstrauch.github.io/projects/neptune/index.html). *Check it out!*
